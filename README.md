# The MulQuaBio Coursework

This folder contains coursework for the MulQuaBio course.  Content can be found at https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/.  I am currently pursuing an MSc in Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation at Imperial College.  Although this material isn't covered under this course, a different course on computational methods in the same department covers it.  I'm working through it at my own pace to brush up on Python and develop other skills.

# Project Structure

The directory structure will follow the structure of the MulQuaBio coursework, with folders for the Computing, Basic Data Analyses and Statistics, and Advanced Data Analyses and Statistics sections.  Within each folder will be Code, Data, and Sandbox folders.  The Data folders will be for holding data.  Sandbox contains various files I work through in each section.  Code contains results of the Practical challenges.  Otherwise, there is no organization of subsections (I mean, this is just self paced work, that's good enough, don't you think?).

# Languages

I believe that Practicals will mostly be in R and Python, plus some bash shell scripts.

# Dependencies

No dependencies yet, but I'll add them here as I encounter them.
